In this project I used MySQL as the database, the necessary querys are with the files. The functionalities included creating your user, following other users, posting your tweets, and seeing the number of tweets you made, how many followers you have, and how many people you follow. This project was taught by Jamilton Damasceno and Jorge Sant Ana in their Web Development course.
