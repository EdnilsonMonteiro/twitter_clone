# twitter_clone
A clone of Twitter using php language.

# More about

In this project I used MySQL as the database, the necessary querys are with the files. The functionalities included creating your user, following other users, posting your tweets, and seeing the number of tweets you made, how many followers you have, and how many people you follow. This project was taught by Jamilton Damasceno and Jorge Sant Ana in their Web Development course.

#Run project

To run this project you will need to have Php and Xamp installed. At Xamp, you will need to run Apache and MySQL modules. Your project folder can be any place you would like it to be, then you should use your terminal and get at the project's folder. So the path would look like this: C:\[your_folder_destination]\[twitter_clone]\public. Once you made all those steps you'll only need to digit: php -S localhost:8080. 
Perfect! Enjoy using the twitter_clone!!
